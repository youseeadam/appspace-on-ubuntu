# AppSpace on Ubuntu
I like using Ubuntu for this because it's free and lightweight, allowing you to run AppSpace on almost any hardware that support Ubuntu.  I tried this on a RaspberryPi 4, it didn't work too well, not enough resources availalbe. This was tested using Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
* Install Ubuntu Server as you normally would.  It's not super complex.
* During the setup, you are asked for a username and password.  For the purposes of this documentation, we will use this account for running AppSpace
* Login wht the username you created during setup
* Update the System
